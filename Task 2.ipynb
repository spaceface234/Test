    "# Task 2 - Detecting Fraudulent Sales\n",
    "You were just hired by BA Toys as an Internal Auditor. The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) is also new and has been reviewing processes surrounding the purchasing and sales processes. The internal controls appear to be well-designed, but the external auditor has raised some concerns about revenues. Specifically, the auditor claims that their analytics-based risk assessment suggests sales appear inconsistent with inventory levels. The CAE has reviewed the auditor‚Äôs evidence and agrees the issue warrants investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAE has tasked you with reviewing inventory records, purchasing activity, and sales activity. She has obtained the data for you from the relevant departments. Below, she provides a description of each data source as well as what she can ascertain from the data. However, her information may be incomplete, and she conveys that the departments (Sales, Purchasing, and Inventory Management) are unlikely to be of much help. Like most retailers, BA‚Äôs fiscal year-end is January 31, and you will be focusing on the year ended January 31, 2018."

    "The Sales, Purchases, and Returns files all have timestamps that would allow you to evaluate inventory at any given date. However, I suggest simplifying your analysis based on the specific question of whether there are fraudulent sales in the year (regardless of when they occur). In other words, begin by considering total purchases (by store-product), total sales (by store-product), etc. Collapse the datasets using the idenfier(s) corresponding to unique Store-Brand combinations. This may be sufficient to uncover any issues. If it is not, then you can circle back and perform a more detailed analysis at the daily level (but, hint, you shouldn‚Äôt have to)."
